        <p>Woolen yarns,
            usually made from shorter fibres,
            are thick and full and are used for such full-bodied items as tweed fabrics and blankets. Worsteds,
            usually made from longer fibre,
            are fine, smooth,fand durable. They are used for fine dress fabrics and suitings. Wool that has had no
            previous use is
            described as new wool,
            or,
            in the United States,
            as virgin wool. The limited world supply results in the use of recovered wools. In the United States,
            wool recovered from fabric never used by the consumer is called reprocessed wool;
            wool recovered from material that has had use is called reused wool. Recovered wools,
            employed mainly in woolens and blends,
            are often of inferior quality because of damage suffered during the recovery process.</p>

            <h3>wool process</h3>
            <p>Humans have been washing,weaving,and wearing wool since 10, 000 BCE. There are more than 1,
                000 sheep breeds in the world. Breeds like the Merino or Rambouillet produce fine wools used mainly for
                apparel. Breeds like Romney or Scottish Blackface produce thicker wools used generally for such as
                interior textiles,
                d√©cor and carpets. Merino sheep originated in Spain. In 1789 King Charles IV of Spain gave six Merino
                sheep as a gift to the Dutch government. These sheep found their way to South Africa,
                and then were sold to British army officer,politician,and entrepreneur John Macarthur,
                who took them to Australia. Today Australia produces 80% of the Merino wool used in luxury fashion and
                suiting around the world </p>

        <h4>The aside element</h4>
        <p>Australia is the world's largest producer of raw wool, growing about 30 percent of the total world
            supply.Less wool is produced than in the middle 20th century, because people use more synthetic fibers.
            Sheepwere domesticated (tamed) in southwestern Asia about 11,000 years ago and now about 1 billion are now widely
            bred around the world Wikimedia Commons has media related to Wool. Wool is produced by follicles which are
            small cells located is the skin. These follicles are located in the upper layer of the skin called the
            epidermis and push down into the second skin layer called the dermis as the wool fibers grow.</p>
        <aside>
            <p> Follicles can beclassed as either primary or secondary follicles. Primary follicles produce three types
                of fiber, Kemp (wool),medullated fibers and true wool fibers. </p>
        </aside>
        <p>
            Secondary follicles only produce true wool fibers. Medullated fibers share nearly identical characteristics
            to hair and are long but lack crimp and elasticity. Kemp fibers are very coarse and shed out.
